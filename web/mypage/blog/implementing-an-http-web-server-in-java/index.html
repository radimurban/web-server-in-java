<h1>Building a simple HTTP multi-threaded web server in Java</h1>
<span style="color:gray;">22. 3. 2022</span>
<h2>Task and Goal</h2> 
<p>
    The goal is to learn how to implement an easy <b>multi-threaded</b> (= being 
    able to handle multiple connections/requests at once) web server in Java.
    <br>
    Extension: <i>Add proper HTTP/1.1 keep-alive behavior to your 
        implementation based on the http-client's capabilities 
        exposed through its request headers.</i>

</p>
<h2>Resources and readings</h2>
<p>
    I have never done this before, so I am listing the following links which 
    I used to learn about everything I needed to know to make this work.

<h2>How does an HTTP server work?</h2>
<p>
    A server is a computer. It needs to be connected to the network to be able to receive 
    the requests. It will be listening through ports (for example 80 for not encrypted and 
    443 for encrypted traffic). Usual requests are files or something in the file system (web root).
     The server will look for the file(s) that match the request and sends a response back to the browser 
     through the established connection. After the browser receives the response, the server closes the connection. 
     There is therefore a new connection established for every single request coming from the browser. We can now sum 
     up what we need to do.
</p>
<h2>What needs to be implemented</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Server must be able to listen to a <i>(configurable)</i> port and therefore to read the configuration files (JSON) and how to write them</li>
    <li>Establishing connection between the browser and the server</li>
    <li>Read requests messages and understanding them</li>
    <li>Handling the requests (accessing file system)</li>
    <li>Composing the response</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Implementing and handling the configurations</h2>
<p>
    For keeping the configurations in one place, we will use JSON. <br>
    We need to configure: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Port (int):</b> so far one, we can configure more later, our server will listen to this port</li>
    <li><b>Webroot (string):</b> pathway of where the files are saved</li>
</ol>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/bd66ec94cb290e3fa7526160d7dd88fe.js"></script>
<p>
    We will now write the configuration handler class as well as
     configuration class. Both will be in the package of the http server and in 
     the same configuration package within the http server package.
     <br>
     The actual configuration class is trivial and will look like this: 
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/983cafc9b3a155a65e0a43be4b007e3c.js"></script>
<p>This where we retrieve the configuration data from. It will basically be an object containing the configuration data.
 <br>
    Now we need to write the configuration handler. Our handler needs to be able to (those will be separate functions):

</p>
<ol>
    <li>Load the Configuration</li>
    <li>Get the Configuration</li>
</ol>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/d27797ca2d3068df04ca4c119fb832b0.js"></script>

<p>
    Now we need to figure out a way how to parse 
    the JSON file and create the Configuration object . 
    This is a pretty complicated step (at least if you're doing this for the first time).
</p>

<h3>Parsing JSON in Java</h3>
<p>
    To keep the dependencies in order, we'll use <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> and for the actual parsing the <b>Jackson</b> 
    library which can be used for parsing and generating JSON files. It has an Object Mapper class that can process JSON files and create 
    Java objects out of them, which is exactly what we need.
<br>
In order to use the Jackson library, we need to define the dependencies (Maven files need to be in our classpath). 
</p>
<h4>Defining the dependencies</h4>
<p>
    The pom.xml file looks like this:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/c1f159dca7b22d998d0965b5a6fa90ba.js"></script>
<h4>Java class handling the JSON files</h4>
<p>
    In this class, that we will make use of the <code>ObjectMapper()</code> which we will import from the jackson.databind. 

There are two ways to get/use the ObjectMapper. You can either just use the default one or configure your own. If you dont want to configure it at all, you can just use <code>public static ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();</code>. Otherwise create the function that returns the ObjectMapper and configure it within the function before you return it.

Another part of the Jackson library is the JsonNode. This class represents the structure of the original JSON file. We will first want to transform/map the JSON into this class (object). We define the function <code>getJsonNode()</code> to get this JsonNode representation. It will take in one argument - the string representation of the JSON file.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/8470c1581b8d3a3514f0a6e250f916bd.js"></script>
<p>
    Using this if we for example take our JSON configuration file to test the output of this <code>getJsonNode()</code> function. That is, for the following JSON:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/bd66ec94cb290e3fa7526160d7dd88fe.js"></script>
<p>
    We have string representation <i>"{\"port\":8080, \"webroot\":\"path\"}"</i> and the 
    ouput of the function <code>getJsonNode()</code> is an JsonNode object on which we can for example call:
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/449f13b0fc344e336ee16650cb400cb3.js"></script>
<p>
    At this point we need to move the JsonNode object into the Configuration object/class. For that we need to define another function in the JsonHandler class. <br>
We can do this using the ObjectMapper and its <code>treeToValue(JsonNode, Class &lt;T&gt;)</code>. This function returns the class we want the JsonNode to transform into (we pass this as a second argument).
At the same time we can define a function that is the inverse to JsonToClass. This function will accept an object as an argument ans will return the JsonNode object.
Another thing that can be useful is to get a way to get the Configuration as a string, which is basically a JSON.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/fb14a122b5af4712328991e9190ed60e.js"></script>
<p>
    Now we have everything we need to process and to work with the JSON files.
</p>
<h3>Configuration Handler </h3>

<p>
    We can now proceed to implement the methods of the ConfigurationHandler class.
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <code>loadconfig()</code>: we need to find the file at given path and read it completely. Good way to save its content could the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html">StringBuffer</a>. Let's just simply iterate over 
        the content of the file and use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStreamReader.html#read()"><code>read()</code></a> to read its content. <code>read()</code> will return <code>-1</code> as soon as we reach the end of the file.
        After that, we can make use of the function <code>getJsonNode()</code> we defined in the previous part to get the JsonNode representation.</li>
    <li> <code>getCurrentConfig()</code>: This is just a simple method that will return the current configuration. (Mind the <code>NullPointerException()</code>). A possible improvement here could working out the exceptions in a better way. </li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/a936587eb36c6d0f6410fce39dc32b6c.js"></script>
<p>
    This should be everything we need to be able to work with configurations. 
    Now we just need to import it into the main HttpServer class and instantiate and we can use it.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/6584bb15d8ede0a3794dfd41c44a453d.js"></script>
<p>
    Assuming the previous JSON Configuration this <code>config</code> would return 8080 on <code>congif.getPort()</code> and "path" on <code>config.getWebrot()</code>.
</p>
<h2>2. Establishing a connection and using server sockets</h2>
<p>
    To establish the connection, we need to have a socket that is going to listen to the port. 
    Java has a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html">net library</a> which provides 
    classes for networking applications. One of them is the *Server Socket*. A server socket waits for 
    requests to come in over the network. It performs some operation based on that request, and then possibly 
    returns a result to the requester. To create a server socket *bounded to a specific port*, we construct the 
    object and pass the port number as a parameter. We can easily retrieve this from our Configuration object.
</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/dc57a3dd4a0c8dca1437b141a01e4e24.js"></script>
<p>
    Now we can say we want the socket to wait for the connection to be established. The function <code>accept()</code> listens for a connection 
    to be made to this socket and accepts it. The method blocks until a connection is made. Once a connection is made, Socket is returned. 
    A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines. <br>
Socket has two methods we will want to use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>getInputStream()</code>: returns an <i>input stream</i> for reading bytes from this socket. Based on the <i>input stream</i> we will decide what to return as a response to the browser.</li>
    <li><code>getOutputStream()</code>: returns an <i>output stream</i> for writing bytes to this socket. Using the <i>output stream</i> (and its method <code>write()</code>) we will be able to send the response to the browser</li>
</ul>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/radimurban/c6a50710e9b71834c5571b52762b8413.js"></script>

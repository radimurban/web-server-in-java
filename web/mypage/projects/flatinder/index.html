<h1>Flatinder</h1>

  
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>From September 24 to 26, I participated in the largest 
        hackathon in Europe. Me and my team decided to try to solve the 
        problem of finding a shared flat (WG) for students in cities like Zurich.
         The main idea was to create a social network for both parties who may be affected
          by this problem; that is, for individuals looking for new housing, but also for existing
           tenants looking for new suitable roommates. During these 40 hours, we managed to create 
           a partially functioning model and submit the project for evaluation. A total of 155 teams 
           submitted the project. 25 projects were selected for the final selection and although ours 
           was not among them, it was a great experience and I would recommend everyone to take part next year. </p>
    
<h2>Project proposal</h2>
<p>Motivation: 
    <i>
        Finding a good place to live is hard but very important. Finding a suitable new flat-mate
    of your shared flat might be even 
   harder but just as important. We try to make this easier and more efficient. <br>
   
   Flatinder is an app, where shared flat owners can search suitable applicants based on the
    profile parameters and applicants can find the shared flats of their dreams.
